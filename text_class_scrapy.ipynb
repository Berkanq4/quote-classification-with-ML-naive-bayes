        "• Scrape enough data\n",
        "o How can you decide the data is enough?\n",
        "    I measure the accuracy, as long as data is good. I feed the model with that.\n",
        "o Explain your thought process and do experiments\n",
        "      -First, i scrapped the data from website, then; I put the data into dataframe. Ussually quotes had more than one tags therefore i needed to put the same quotes more than one time to have the all tags.\n",
        "o How did you select the possible labels?\n",
        "  I used the tags on the website.\n",
        "• Convert text data into numeric data\n",
        "    I used make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer()) That converted the sentences into numerical vectors\n",
        "o What are the options? (At most 1 sentence for each technique is enough)\n",
        "o Why did you choose your option ?\n",
        "    because it was easy and simple to implement. Straightforward.\n",
        "• Create a model\n",
        "o How did you choose your model?\n",
        "    Naive Bayes is known for its success in text classification. I used logisticRegression because it's very basic and i was a validation\n",
        "• Train your model\n",
        "o Can you train you models in different ways? What are the parameters?\n",
        "  Yes, we can train the models in different ways. quotes and the tags are the parameters.\n",
        "• Evaluate your model\n",
        "• Explain what could you do better if you were given enough resources?\n",
        "    I would build a neural network model and tokenize each word. I would add padding\n",
        "• What improvements can be made on your project?\n",
        "\n",
        "  We could just remove the stop words. I already put the function for that but i didn't remove the stop words because I wanted to keep it simple///\n",
        "• Where could you use such a project? Please give 2 examples...\n",
        "\n",
        "1) E-book storing.\n",
        "2) Movie classification.\n",

        "I had to make it as simple as possible also I had to preserve the accuracy as well. Therefore, i scrapped the website first then, put the data into dataframe and then altered the dataframe and then vectorized the data and put into the ml models."

No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?

But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.

Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”', '“Not all those who wander are lost.”', '“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”', '“There is nothing to writing.

What truly horrible lives they must lead.”', '“The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.”', '“Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!”', \"“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”\", '“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept.”', \"“You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
